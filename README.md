# Project-Pass
Now just a CLI password manager, Project Pass aims to develop my own knowledge on Rust and Cryptography.

This project is in no way fit for use in its current version.


## Lessons Learned
1. Rocket on Nightly Rust was a headache. Rocket on Stable Rust could be the future, but the ecosystem is young
2. GPT 3.5 is pretty bad at Rust. Seems I need to shell out some doubloons if I want a Rust coding assistant
3. [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto) has been great.
4. Rust is maturing and many of these crates will likely change. Stay as modular as possible
